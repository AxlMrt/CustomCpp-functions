# Custom String Manipulation Functions

This repository contains custom implementations of fundamental string manipulation functions in C++.




## Programs
### 1. stod - String to Double Conversion
- File: stod_conversion.cpp
- Description: This program implements a custom stod function that converts a character array to a double, mimicking the behavior of C++'s stod function. It handles positive and negative numbers and decimal points within the string.

### 2. stoi - String to Integer Conversion
- File: stoi_conversion.cpp
- Description: The program implements a custom stoi function that converts a character array to an integer, similar to C++'s stoi function. It handles positive and negative integers.

### 3. strcomp - String Comparison
- File: string_comparison.cpp
- Description: This program implements a custom strcomp function that compares two character arrays. It iterates through both arrays to determine if they are equal or not.

### 4. strcpy - String Copy
- File: string_copy.cpp
- Description: The program implements a custom strcpy function that copies one character array into another. It mimics the behavior of C++'s strcpy function.

### 5. strlen - String Length Calculation
- File: string_length.cpp
- Description: This program implements a custom strlen function that calculates the length of a character array. It iterates through the array to determine its length.

### 6. myTo_string - Integer to String Conversion
- File: integer_to_string_conversion.cpp
- Description: This program implements a custom myTo_string function that converts an integer to a character array, mimicking the behavior of C++'s to_string function.


Each program contains a custom implementation of a fundamental string manipulation function and demonstrates how these functions operate internally. They were created to understand and practice handling pointers and string manipulation in C++.
